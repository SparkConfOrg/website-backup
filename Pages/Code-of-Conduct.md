# Code of Conduct

Spark Conference is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.

We value the participation of each member of the community. We want you to have an enjoyable experience, to fill your day with meaningful conversations, and to get to know your peers. We expect all attendees, volunteers, and sponsors to show respect and courtesy to others.

To understand what's expected we've outlined the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this (legally non-binding) code throughout the event.

### TL;DR VERSION

Spark Conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Language or imagery that's sexual in nature or has sexual overtones or innuendos are not appropriate, even in conference talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

### LONG VERSION

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Exhibitors (including volunteers) should not wear unprofessional attire.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

### IF THERE IS A PROBLEM

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff or campus security immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their colored golf shirts and special badges.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
