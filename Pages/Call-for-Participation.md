It only takes a *spark of curiosity* to ignite *genius*.<br />
It only takes a *spark of passion* to ignite *teaching*.<br />
It only takes a *spark of motivation* to ignite *community*.<br />
It only takes a *spark of imagination* to ignite *dreams*.<br />
*It only takes a spark.*

A small fiery particle of curiosity, passion, and motivation can ignite great things within us all. It only takes a spark for an idea to create new and innovative things. Please consider sharing your spark with the community at the 2015 Spark Conference on Saturday, June 6, at the UNC Charlotte Center City campus in uptown Charlotte, NC. Thoughts will be sparked. Questions will be answered. And fun will be had. The only thing missing is you!

Spark Conference is a generalist technology conference focusing on education, a family-friendly environment, and lots of networking. We are looking for interesting topics from a wide array of speakers to make our conference as diverse as possible. This is our public Call for Participation (CFP), and below is an outline of how our CFP works.

### IMPORTANT DATES

* **April 12:** Call for Participation Ends
* **April 24:** Session Voting Ends
* **April 30:** Session Selection Ends

### TRACKS

We are looking for topics in the following general tracks:

* **Design** — Sessions focused on UI/UX design principals, tools, and techniques.
* **Developer** — Sessions for software developers, testers, architects, or project managers.
* **Internet of Things** — Sessions around the network of physical objects or embedded "things".
* **IT Professional** — Sessions for server, database, or network administrators.
* **Startup** — Sessions around founding a technology startup or running a technology company.
* **STEM** — Sessions for K-12 students interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
* **Panel Discussion** — Discussions that you will be organizing to discuss one of the tracks above.

### SELECTION PROCESS

Two things happen following the deadline for submitting sessions. First, we give your adoring fans (or family) an opportunity to "Like" and "Comment" on your session submission. These "votes" are not scientific but do help us judge the community's interest in your session. This interest influences the final schedule.

Secondly, we break submissions into "tracks". Tracks are coordinated by a track coordinator (hence the ingenious name, don't you think?). The track coordinators know they must fill the limited number of sessions with the best talks they can find. Sometimes, this task is easy. More often than not, the coordinators gather to debate which sessions to include in the schedule. Next, the coordinators submit their recommendations to the event organizers (Mark and Syl). They check the selections to verify the content is well-balanced and exciting for attendees.

### DIVERSITY COMMITMENT

At Spark Conference, we value diversity. We want a conference where a Ruby developer can learn from a .NET developer. Where a iOS developer can learn from an Android developer. Et cetera and vice versa. This commitment goes beyond the diversity of technical framework stacks and hardware. We also value diversity on our organizing committee, speakers, volunteers, and attendees. Learning about a subject from a different perspective is important and enriches us all. We welcome and encourage submissions from everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

### FIRST-TIME SPEAKERS

If you have ever thought about taking the podium, this is your year. We need LOTS of presentations to get a well-balanced and exciting set of content for attendees. We know nothing presents as well as experience.

**What is the difference between a speaker and an attendee?**

A speaker is the person standing at the front of the room doing most of the talking. That may seem obvious, but too often we think of speakers as a special group of people with supernatural powers. Speakers are just attendees who are ready to lead a session. If you have ever thought about taking the podium, we want to encourage you to submit a session.

**What if I can't think of an interesting topic?**

If you've been working as a Developer, IT Pro, or DBA for a year or more you have picked up a trick or two. Maybe you have a favorite tool, or were happy with the way a project turned out. Each one of these can be the basis of a talk.

**What if I'm not an expert?**

Nothing presents as well as experience. And sharing your experience is as helpful as deep technical expertise. Spend some time researching your topic area but you do not need to be an expert to lead a session.

**What if I'm not comfortable speaking in public?**

Few people are comfortable speaking in public the first time. There are some things you can do to overcome that fear. You can ask to speak at your local users group. You can speak to a group at your company. You can even speak in front of a mirror. The point is you can overcome a fear of public speaking by speaking.

Take the first step by picking a topic and registering as a speaker today!

### SPEAKER EXPECTATIONS

We're excited that you're interested in becoming a speaker! Please understand that we have the following expectations of our speakers:

**Be polite.**

Be respectful towards everyone. Spark Conference is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. This is especially true for our speakers. Please conduct yourself in a professional manner and check your content to ensure that it is not offensive to others.

**Be prompt.**

Be at the event early and be ready to begin when your session starts. Please notify us immediately if your plans change or you are delayed in your arrival for any reason.

**Be prepared.**

You have a room full of attendees who have chosen your session among all the other excellent sessions going on at that moment. Be respectful of their time and their trust in you.

**Be productive.**

Attendees have chosen your session to hear about your personal expertise in a given topic. This is not the time or the place to make a sales pitch for a company, sell your product, or hire you as a consultant.

**Please, do not parachute.**

Arriving just before your session, presenting, and then disappearing is called parachuting. Please, do not parachute. Stick around for the full conference and interact with attendees and other speakers.

**Please, share your presentation.**

At some point, please share your presentation with us and the attendees. Once the conference is over, we would like to link to your slides and any source code you demonstrated during your presentation. Please get this information to us in a timely manor.

### MORE INFORMATION

* Be sure to talk up the conference on all social networks.
* There will be a Very Important Presenter (VIP) Reception. We are still determining the exact time and venue for this special event, but we will be sure to keep everyone informed.
* Please contact us if your travel requirements necessitate a morning or afternoon presentation.
* A speaker lounge will be available for you to prepare for your session(s). We encourage you to attend other sessions and join the attendees when you are not preparing.
* We cannot guarantee internet access for speakers so please have contingency plans. We are making every effort to have internet access available for all attendees. But understand that 400 geeks in one place can be a challenge for any Wi-Fi network.
* Spark Conference is an all-volunteer, community event. No one is paid for their role.
