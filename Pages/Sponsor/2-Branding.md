## Branding Opportunities
Spark Conference is offering the following very unique and precious branding sponsorship opportunities. Please contact us to discuss the details!

### VIP RECEPTION
Want to be the swankiest sponsor in town? Your sponsorship helps underwrite the pre-conference VIP reception. We only invite our Very Important Presenters (VIPs) and select guests to this mixer. We accept multiple sponsors for this event. However, the first sponsor to sign up may elect to cover all costs creating an exclusive sponsorship opportunity for this important reception.<br />
**Cost: TBD**

### SATURDAY LUNCH
We will be providing a mid-day lunch on Saturday to everyone in attendance. This year, we'd like to offer a hot buffet style meal rather than a stale boxed lunch, soggy sandwiches, or worse, cold pizza. The Saturday lunch sponsor will have their logo incorporated into the buffet line. The sponsor may provide a single page collateral in a designated location. We guarantee every attendee will want to shake your hand in appreciation of a great meal!<br />
**Cost: TBD**

### SNACK TABLE
With a jam-packed day of intensive learning, our attendees need to replenish their energy. This year, we’d like to keep snack tables generously stocked during the conference. The snack table sponsor will have their logo incorporated into the snack bar. The sponsor may provide a single page collateral in a designated location at the snack bar.<br />
**Cost: TBD**

### AFTER PARTY
Many attendees stick around to kick back and relax after the end of the conference. Food, drinks, conversation—and we will place your company’s branding all around! You’ll also have a table just for your own use. Mix with attendees as they unwind and discuss all the great things they learned during Spark Conference! We accept multiple sponsors for this event. However, the first sponsor to sign up may elect to cover all costs creating an exclusive sponsorship opportunity for this highly visible party.<br />
**Cost: TBD**

### ATTENDEE PARKING
Imagine your company's branding being one of the first thing every attendee will see the day of the conference. UNC Charlotte does not own or manage the parking lots around the building. Attendees will be charged $5 per car unless they are UNC Charlotte faculty, staff, or students that have a main campus parking permit. The attendee parking sponsor will underwrite the cost of hiring a parking attendant to direct and tally attendees. This sponsorship offers an opportunity to have their logo prominently displayed on all parking signage around the building.<br />
**Cost: $2,500**

### CONFERENCE APP
We want to engage attendees before, during, and after the conference by replacing outdated, printed schedules and sponsor collateral with a mobile app that houses all event content—from session information to speaker bios, exhibitor details and more. The conference app sponsor will have their logo prominently displayed within the app. This sponsorship offers an opportunity to help make our conference greener while greatly increasing the number of attendee brand impressions.<br />
**Cost: $1,000**

### REGISTRATION
Imagine your company's branding being one of the first thing every attendee will see the day of the conference. The registration sponsor will have their logo prominently displayed on a small banner attached to each check-in kiosk. This sponsorship offers an opportunity to make a positive and lasting brand impression as soon as attendees walk in the door.<br />
**Cost: $750 + Rentals**

### ATTENDEE T-SHIRT
Each attendee could receive a conference t-shirt with the Spark Conference logo on the front. The T-shirt sponsor will have their logo prominently displayed on a sleeve of their choosing. This sponsorship offers an opportunity to have your company displayed on a long-lasting t-shirt which will be used by each attendee for years.<br />
