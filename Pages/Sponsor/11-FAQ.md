## FAQ

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: We’re working against budget schedules. Can we commit to sponsorship now but pay closer to the event?**<br />
**A:** Yes; however, your benefits will not be activated until we receive payment. All benefits are first-come, first-served based on the date we receive your payment. Spark Conference is an event completely run by volunteers. We simply don’t have the bandwidth to deal with Accounts Receivable.

**Q: What is “Preferential Logo Placement”?**<br />
**A:** Whenever all sponsor logos are displayed together, they will be arranged from left to right and top to bottom within the various sponsorship levels by the total contribution size (largest first) and the date that payment was received (earliest first).

**Q: May we contribute more than the minimum amount for a given sponsorship level?**<br />
**A:** Yes. This will count towards your total contribution for logo placement and purchase limit for additional opportunities.

**Q: We have a great idea for a sponsorship opportunity that you haven’t listed. What can we do?**<br />
**A:** Pitch the idea to us and we’ll work with you to help you put on something educational, helpful, or just plain fun.

**Q: Are there any restrictions on booths? What’s included?**<br />
**A:** Exhibiting sponsors will receive a table, 2 chairs, a power strip, and the booth space paid for. We encourage our sponsors to think out of the box when designing their booth and are happy to help with any special requests. To ensure safety of all of our attendees, your exhibit must fit into your designated booth space. The Fire Marshall may inspect booths for safety.

**Q: Do we get a copy of attendee mailing list?**<br />
**A:** We greatly respect the privacy of our attendees. We hate spam too! We will never ever share our mailing list with others. However, you are more than welcome to create your own mailing list during the conference.
