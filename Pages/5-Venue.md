## AN ICONIC AND AWARD WINNING **VENUE**

### [UNC Charlotte Center City](http://centercity.uncc.edu/)

The Center City Building is an iconic and uniquely academic presence within the fabric of downtown Charlotte. As the UNC system’s first urban campus, it provides visibility within the city and anchors the creation of a new four-acre park on the adjacent site.

UNC Charlotte Center City functions as a gateway to the entire University of North Carolina at Charlotte and as such embodies UNC Charlotte’s urban identity in the heart of the greater Charlotte region. Architecturally, it reflects its mission as a premier institution of higher education; its context in this vibrant, rapidly urbanizing area; and its commitment to environmental sustainability.
