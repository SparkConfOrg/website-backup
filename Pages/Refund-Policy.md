# Refund Policy

If by chance you purchase your ticket and can no longer make it to Spark Conference, we recommend that you take a minute (or two) to review the following policies.

### REFUND/CANCELLATION POLICY

If you decide to cancel your conference ticket, Spark Conference will refund you under the following two conditions:

1. You must cancel your ticket within thirty (30) days after purchase. It becomes too hard after this time because of credit card restrictions.
2. You must cancel your ticket before 11:59 PM EDT on Sunday, May 15, 2016. We must place orders, provide vendors with counts, and generally pay for everything early on May 16th.

All sales are final beginning 12:00 AM EDT on Monday, May 16, 2016. Please see [Eventbrite's instructions on how to request a refund](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/can-i-get-a-refund). Please allow up to four (4) business days for one of our volunteers to respond. We will endeavor to complete refunds within thirty (30) days.  All refunds are less any service and/or payment processing fees charged. Once a refund is initiated, it can take up to 5 business days to show up in your account (7 business days internationally,) depending on the bank.

### TICKET TRANSFER POLICY 

If you cannot attend the conference, you may transfer your ticket to another person. Ticket transfers can happen any time and have no deadline. Please see [Eventbrite's instructions on how to transfer tickets to someone else](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/Q_A/how-to-transfer-tickets-to-someone-else). Only the owner of the original purchase from Eventbrite can edit the attendees on an order. If that is not you, please contact the original buyer to change the attendee information. The Spark Conference staff have no control over this.

### RESALE POLICY

Scalpers are uncool. Tickets may not be resold for more than their initial purchase price. We will not honor any ticket sold or purchased under these circumstances. If you're unable to attend Spark Conference and need to sell your ticket, we are happy to support you with the transfer ticket option mentioned above &ndash; but sell your ticket at the same price you bought it for. Be kind!

**NOTE: Neither Spark Conference nor [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/tos/) are responsible for any third-party ticket sales.**
