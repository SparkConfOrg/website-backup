**What happened to the code camp?**

In short, it grew! Due to an overwhelming attendance, we’ve outgrown the previous venue. This presented an opportunity to shake things up…and we couldn’t resist! But rest assured that our goal is to not just match the rich success of Carolina Code Camp but to make it better than ever for our attendees, speakers, and sponsors.
