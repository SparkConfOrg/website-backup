# Spark Conference Website Backup

The [Spark Conference](http://sparkconf.org/) website is currently hosted on [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com/). This repository is a backup/export of the website's content blocks and settings.

The foundation of every Squarespace site is built on individual pages and custom content. You choose a page type based on the kind of content youâ€™d like to add, and then customize each page with blocks and settings. Blocks are the primary means of adding content to your site, including text, images, content links, and third-party tools.
