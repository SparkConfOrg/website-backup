      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="text-align-center">Sponsorship Prospectus</h1><hr /><h2>Thank you for your interest in sponsoring Spark Conference!</h2><p>The Spark Conference is the premier, must-attend event for technology enthusiasts in the South Atlantic region. This sponsorship prospectus offers your company a unique opportunity. You will have access to a highly engaged, passionate, driven audience. It is a truly special group of individuals. Formerly Carolina Code Camp, the Spark Conference is the best place for companies to connect with top-notch talent and decision makers.</p><h3>What Happened to Code Camp?</h3><p>In short, it grew! Due to an overwhelming attendance, we've outgrown the previous venue. This presented an opportunity to shake things up…and we couldn't resist! But rest assured that our goal is to not just match the rich success of Carolina Code Camp but to make it better than ever for our attendees and sponsors.</p><h3>Why Should I Sponsor?</h3><p>With topics including UI/UX design, mobile development, cloud computing, and business intelligence (just to name a few), we guarantee this event will connect your business to the best professionals in the industry. Additionally, sponsoring Spark Conference is a prime opportunity for your organization to take part in fostering the development of the Charlotte IT community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sponsor FAQ</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2015 01:46:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Q: We’re working against budget schedules. Can we commit to sponsorship now but pay closer to the event?<br />A:</strong> Yes; however, your benefits will not be activated until we receive payment. All benefits are first-come, first-served based on the date we receive your payment. Spark Conference is an event completely run by volunteers. We simply don’t have the bandwidth to deal with Accounts Receivable.</p><p><strong>Q: What is “Preferential Logo Placement”?<br />A:</strong> Whenever all sponsor logos are displayed together, they will be arranged from left to right and top to bottom within the various sponsorship levels by the total contribution size (largest first) and the date that payment was received (earliest first).</p><p><strong>Q: May we contribute more than the minimum amount for a given sponsorship level?<br />A:</strong> Yes. This will count towards your total contribution for logo placement and purchase limit for additional opportunities.</p><p><strong>Q: We have a great idea for a sponsorship opportunity that you haven’t listed. What can we do?<br />A:</strong> Pitch the idea to us and we’ll work with you to help you put on something educational, helpful, or just plain fun.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there any restrictions on booths? What’s included?<br />A:</strong> Exhibiting sponsors will receive a table, 2 chairs, a power strip, and the booth space paid for. We encourage our sponsors to think out of the box when designing their booth and are happy to help with any special requests. To ensure safety of all of our attendees, your exhibit must fit into your designated booth space. The Fire Marshall may inspect booths for safety.</p><p><strong>Q: Do we get a copy of attendee mailing list?<br />A</strong>: We greatly respect the privacy of our attendees. We hate spam too! We will never ever share our mailing list with others. However, you are more than welcome to create your own mailing list during the conference.</p><hr /><p>Whew! That was a lot of information to share. Hopefully you found it helpful. Please let us know how we can help promote your product/service. We want to create something that’s both interesting and fun for the attendees and beneficial for you as a sponsor. Click the button below to contact us about becoming a sponsor at the 2015 Spark Conference.</p><p>Don’t miss your opportunity to get involved. After all, <em>it only takes a spark!</em></p>

      <title>Branding</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 23:26:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Branding Opportunities</h2><p>Spark Conference is offering the following very unique and precious branding sponsorship opportunities. Please contact us to discuss the details!</p><h3>VIP Reception</h3><p>Want to be the swankiest sponsor in town? Your sponsorship helps underwrite the pre-conference VIP reception. We only invite our Very Important Presenters (VIPs) and select guests to this mixer. We accept multiple sponsors for this event. However, the first sponsor to sign up may elect to cover all costs creating an exclusive sponsorship opportunity for this important reception.<br /><strong>Cost: TBD</strong></p><h3>Saturday Lunch</h3><p>We will be providing a mid-day lunch on Saturday to everyone in attendance. This year, we'd like to offer a hot buffet style meal rather than a stale boxed lunch, soggy sandwiches, or worse, cold pizza. The Saturday lunch sponsor will have their logo incorporated into the buffet line. The sponsor may provide a single page collateral in a designated location. We guarantee every attendee will want to shake your hand in appreciation of a great meal!<br /><strong>Cost: TBD</strong></p><h3>SNACK TABLE</h3><p>With a jam-packed day of intensive learning, our attendees need to replenish their energy. This year, we’d like to keep snack tables generously stocked during the conference. The snack table sponsor will have their logo incorporated into the snack bar. The sponsor may provide a single page collateral in a designated location at the snack bar.<br /><strong>Cost: TBD</strong></p><h3>After Party</h3><p>Many attendees stick around to kick back and relax after the end of the conference. Food, drinks, conversation—and we will place your company’s branding all around! You’ll also have a table just for your own use. Mix with attendees as they unwind and discuss all the great things they learned during Spark Conference! We accept multiple sponsors for this event. However, the first sponsor to sign up may elect to cover all costs creating an exclusive sponsorship opportunity for this highly visible party.<br /><strong>Cost: TBD</strong></p><h3>Attendee Parking</h3><p>Imagine your company's branding being one of the first thing every attendee will see the day of the conference. UNC Charlotte does not own or manage the parking lots around the building.

      <title>Code of Conduct</title>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2015 17:54:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We value the participation of each member of the community. We want you to have an enjoyable experience, to fill your day with meaningful conversations, and to get to know your peers. We expect all attendees, volunteers, and sponsors to show respect and courtesy to others.</p><p>To understand what's expected we've outlined the following Code of Conduct.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p><h3>LONG VERSION</h3><p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p><p>Exhibitors in the hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Exhibitors (including volunteers) should not wear unprofessional attire.</p><p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.</p><h3>IF THERE IS A PROBLEM</h3><p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff or campus security immediately.

      <title>Call for Participation</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 01:10:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="text-align-center">It only takes a <em>spark of curiosity</em> to ignite <em>genius</em>.<br />It only takes a <em>spark of passion</em> to ignite <em>teaching</em>.<br />It only takes a <em>spark of motivation</em> to ignite <em>community</em>.<br />It only takes a <em>spark of imagination</em> to ignite <em>dreams</em>.<br /><em>It only takes a spark.</em></p><p>A small fiery particle of curiosity, passion, and motivation can ignite great things within us all. It only takes a spark for an idea to create new and innovative things. Please consider sharing your spark with the community at the 2015 Spark Conference on Saturday, June 6, at the UNC Charlotte Center City campus in uptown Charlotte, NC. Thoughts will be sparked. Questions will be answered. And fun will be had. The only thing missing is you!</p><p>Spark Conference is a generalist technology conference focusing on education, a family-friendly environment, and lots of networking. We are looking for interesting topics from a wide array of speakers to make our conference as diverse as possible. This is our public Call for Participation (CFP), and below is an outline of how our CFP works.</p><h3>IMPORTANT DATES</h3><ul><li><strong>April 12:</strong> Call for Participation Ends</li><li><strong>April 24:</strong> Session Voting Ends</li><li><strong>April 30:</strong> Session Selection Ends</li></ul><h3>TRACKS</h3><p>We are looking for topics in the following general tracks:</p><ul><li><strong>Design</strong> — Sessions focused on UI/UX design principals, tools, and techniques.</li><li><strong>Developer</strong> — Sessions for software developers, testers, architects, or project managers.</li><li><strong>Internet of Things</strong> — Sessions around the network of physical objects or embedded "things".</li><li><strong>IT Professional</strong> — Sessions for server, database, or network administrators.</li><li><strong>Startup</strong> — Sessions around founding a technology startup or running a technology company.</li><li><strong>STEM</strong> — Sessions for K-12 students interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</li><li><strong>Panel Discussion</strong> — Discussions that you will be organizing to discuss one of the tracks above.</li></ul><h3>SELECTION PROCESS</h3><p>Two things happen following the deadline for submitting sessions. First, we give your adoring fans (or family) an opportunity to "Like" and "Comment" on your session submission. These "votes" are not scientific but do help us judge the community's interest in your session. This interest influences the final schedule.</p><p>Secondly, we break submissions into "tracks". Tracks are coordinated by a track coordinator (hence the ingenious name, don't you think?). The track coordinators know they must fill the limited number of sessions with the best talks they can find. Sometimes, this task is easy. More often than not, the coordinators gather to debate which sessions to include in the schedule. Next, the coordinators submit their recommendations to the event organizers (Mark and Syl). They check the selections to verify the content is well-balanced and exciting for attendees.</p><h3>DIVERSITY COMMITMENT</h3><p>At Spark Conference, we value diversity. We want a conference where a Ruby developer can learn from a .NET developer. Where a iOS developer can learn from an Android developer. Et cetera and vice versa. This commitment goes beyond the diversity of technical framework stacks and hardware. We also value diversity on our organizing committee, speakers, volunteers, and attendees. Learning about a subject from a different perspective is important and enriches us all. We welcome and encourage submissions from everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.</p><hr /><h3>FIRST-TIME SPEAKERS</h3><p>If you have ever thought about taking the podium, this is your year. We need LOTS of presentations to get a well-balanced and exciting set of content for attendees. We know nothing presents as well as experience.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>What is the difference between a speaker and an attendee?</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">A speaker is the person standing at the front of the room doing most of the talking. That may seem obvious, but too often we think of speakers as a special group of people with supernatural powers. Speakers are just attendees who are ready to lead a session. If you have ever thought about taking the podium, we want to encourage you to submit a session.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>What if I can't think of an interesting topic?</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">If you've been working as a Developer, IT Pro, or DBA for a year or more you have picked up a trick or two. Maybe you have a favorite tool, or were happy with the way a project turned out. Each one of these can be the basis of a talk.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>What if I'm not an expert?</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Nothing presents as well as experience. And sharing your experience is as helpful as deep technical expertise. Spend some time researching your topic area but you do not need to be an expert to lead a session.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>What if I'm not comfortable speaking in public?</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Few people are comfortable speaking in public the first time. There are some things you can do to overcome that fear. You can ask to speak at your local users group. You can speak to a group at your company. You can even speak in front of a mirror. The point is you can overcome a fear of public speaking by speaking.</p><p>Take the first step by picking a topic and registering as a speaker today!</p><hr /><h3>SPEAKER EXPECTATIONS</h3><p>We're excited that you're interested in becoming a speaker! Please understand that we have the following expectations of our speakers:</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Be polite.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Be respectful towards everyone. Spark Conference is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. This is especially true for our speakers. Please conduct yourself in a professional manner and check your content to ensure that it is not offensive to others.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Be prompt.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Be at the event early and be ready to begin when your session starts. Please notify us immediately if your plans change or you are delayed in your arrival for any reason.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Be prepared.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">You have a room full of attendees who have chosen your session among all the other excellent sessions going on at that moment. Be respectful of their time and their trust in you.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Be productive.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Attendees have chosen your session to hear about your personal expertise in a given topic. This is not the time or the place to make a sales pitch for a company, sell your product, or hire you as a consultant.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Please, do not parachute.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">Arriving just before your session, presenting, and then disappearing is called parachuting. Please, do not parachute. Stick around for the full conference and interact with attendees and other speakers.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Please, share your presentation.</strong></p><p style="margin-left:80px">At some point, please share your presentation with us and the attendees.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last five years, the C# and VB compilers were re-written from the ground up. Visual Studio 2015 includes this new compiler and features new extensibility and language capabilities. In this session, we will focus on how these changes will impact you as a C# or VB developer in your day-to-day development. We'll start with exploring the new language features. We'll then look at how to take advantage of code diagnostics and fixes that are publically available. We'll end by exploring some of the extensibility points that you can take advantage of if you want to build your own diagnostics and code fixes.</p><p>Developer | Level 300 (Advanced)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Jim+Wooley">Jim Wooley</a><br />Solution Architect, Slalom</p><p>By day, Jim Wooley is a Solution Architect for Slalom Consulting, In his free time, Jim is a frequent speaker, INETA Regional Speaker, MVP, and author of "LINQ in Action".

      <title>Real Communication with Real People in Real Time with WebRTC. For Reals.</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember that one time you called a business and after entering your account number the person who answers asks for your account number? We’ve generated zettabytes of data for ourselves, yet for 150 years the person on the other end of a call who says “Hello” somehow still knows nothing about you.</p><p>What if instead of asking for an account number, your customer was greeted by name by an agent that already knew what she was calling about. This customer experience is possible with software-driven communication applications, and WebRTC is the technology that will help you get there. WebRTC empowers you to make contextual and intelligent communication something thats is integrated directly into your website and mobile app.</p><p>In this code-driven talk, I’ll introduce you to WebRTC and how you can use it to build real-time, peer-to-peer voice, video and messaging communication directly in a web browser. We’ll explore the JavaScript API’s and network communication concepts needed to make these applications work. If, like me, you’re tired of lame telephone experiences and want to change the world of communication then you must come to this talk.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Devin+Rader">Devin Rader</a><br />Developer Evangelist, Twilio</p><p>Devin Rader is a dad, developer and developer evangelist at Twilio.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to build optimal query plans the SQL Server optimizer relies on statistics to estimate the size of the query workload.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Azure App Service is a one-of-a kind solution that brings together the tools you need for building enterprise-ready apps around a common development, management and billing model. You can choose from a rich ecosystem of pre-built apps and API services as well as a unified set of enterprise capabilities including mobile backend services, turnkey connectivity to SaaS and enterprise systems, and workflow-based creation of business processes.</p><p>Azure App Service frees developers to focus on delivering great business value instead of needing to worry about repetitive tasks such as stitching disparate data sources together or dealing with operational and compliance overhead. This unified approach lets you take full advantage of the service while helping you meet your company’s concerns about security, reliability, and scalability.</p><p>In this session, we will create an enterprise class web application and deploy it using Azure App Service. &nbsp;Once deployed, we will explore extending our application by integrating third party services and automating business processes.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p> </p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Richard+Taylor">Richard L Taylor Jr.</a><br />Sr. Software Developer, Logical Advantage</p><p>I am a 25 year software development and technology professional living in Huntersville, NC.

      <title>Design principles for robust ETL processes</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/25/design-principles-for-robust-etl-processes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the design of your ETL processes sound? Even when using the best ETL technologies, ETL sub-systems are still the most common point of failure of data centric projects. In many cases this is due to improper planning and questionable design principles. In this session we will look at ETL processes from a holistic point of view to identify key areas that are often neglected and that have the potential to affect the system reliability and increase its maintenance cost. We will use SQL Server integration services as reference to cover areas such as re-start ability, monitoring, error handling and auditing and provide you with design principles and patterns you can use to improve the architecture of your ETL processes.</p><p>IT Professional | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Rafael+Salas">Rafael Salas</a><br />Information Architect, Ally Financial</p><p>B: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rafael-salas.com">www.rafael-salas.com</a><br />L: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelsalas">www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelsalas</a><br />T: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/rafsalas">www.twitter.com/rafsalas</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/a-practical-view-of-release-management-for-visual-studio-2013</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This session provides a detailed technical presentation of the functionality and architecture of Release Management for Visual Studio 2013. We start by presenting an overview of the key concepts, architecture, and configuration of the various components. We discuss the out-of-the box deployment actions available to compose automations for common deployment scenarios and how to use extensibility to cover the not-so-common scenarios. In more detail, we discuss the mechanism to manage variables across environments, how to include manual intervention, automated tests and rollbacks as part of a deployment, how to trigger release as part of a build, how to leverage logs to diagnose failed releases, and finally how to add custom actions to the inventory. These are presented through specific scenarios encountered in the field.</p><p>Developer | Level 300 (Advanced)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Derrick+Cawthon">Derrick Cawthon</a><br />Technical Architect ALM, Agile Thought</p><p>Derrick Cawthon is a highly qualified Technical Architect with over 10 years of experience in the technology industry.

      <title>Migrating a Real .NET Application to Azure</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/23/migrating-a-real-net-application-to-azure</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Windows Azure cloud platform promises a number of advantages for .NET developers, but moving an existing application from its current architecture to Azure can seem like an insurmountable task. This session is a combination of a best practices list and a case study of the migration of a large production system written in .NET and SQL Server into Azure, taking advantage of as many of the features of Azure as possible (including worker roles, queues, tables, SQL Azure). The result of this migration was a savings of thousands of dollars per month for the customer and the creation of a much more scalable architecture. We will review the high level features of Azure that were used in the migration and learn some important design details to keep in mind when building things Azure-style. We will also cover some do's and don'ts of migration as learned from experience.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Christopher+Dix">Christopher Dix</a><br />Chief Architect, Thoughtpost, Inc.</p><p>Chris Dix is the president and Chief Architect of Thoughtpost, Inc., a consulting and training company in Charlotte, NC.

We will make the UI much more intelligent about who is using it and we will start predicting attendance of upcoming dinners. This session will also include an introduction to AzureML.

      <title>A Scalable Stack for Modular Web Application</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/a-scalable-stack-for-modular-web-application</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modularity reduces software complexity. OSGi is the best model to modularize Java. It works at development as well as runtime and scales from embedded devices to large, distributed clusters. Web applications implementing modularity at runtime provide interesting capabilities to adapt quickly to customer needs and dynamic environments. But there is no out-of-the-box infrastructure. Few containers provide OSGi support, which is not always complete. Very often, developers start with an OSGi framework by themselves and add technology individually, which results into additional maintenance effort going forward. The open source Eclipse Gyrex Project addresses this problem by providing an infrastructure for building OSGi clusters. It combines successful Eclipse RT technologies such as the Equinox OSGi framework, p2 and Jetty with standards such as JAX-RS, dependency injection and websockets allowing seamless and pain-free creation and operation of clustered OSGi applications. In this session we’ll present a technology stack based on Eclipse Gyrex that can be used for building scalable and modular web applications. We’ll start with an overview and continue with a deep dive through the stack using a sample application. You will also learn about typical cluster deployments for web applications and batch processing, understanding the development workflow and best practices. We’ll also show you how HTML5 and JavaScript based frontends can be developed and deployment alongside the backend supporting its</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Gunnar+Wagenknecht">Gunnar Wagenknecht</a><br />Director of Engineering, Tasktop</p><p>Gunnar Wagenknecht is Director of Engineering at Tasktop where he is responsible for Engineering Services, Operations and Engineering Effectiveness.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coding in a functional language requires more than simply knowing the syntax of that language. You can write a for loop in F# as easily as you can in C#, but you're missing out on the functional aspects of F# (and C# for that matter). We'll introduce the language features of F# and how to unit test by writing several different implementations of the same problem. But more importantly as we write the different implementations we'll discover how a functional mindset can help us better achieve a simple design (in both C# and F#).

      <title>Content Atomization and the First 500,000 Sales</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/content-atomization-and-the-first-500000-sales</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many measures of a successful startup and one of them is 500,000 sales.</p><p>Getting there is easier said than done. The number one reason internet based startups fail is customer acquisition. They simply can't grow a user base fast enough to impress potential investors or -- more importantly -- turn a profit. When discussing successful models, many companies hide behind the mantra of "vitality" without providing a blueprint that you can follow for your own company. Content atomization changes that.</p><p>In this fast paced session founder of LearnToProgram Media, Mark Lassoff, will explain the path to the company's first half-million sales and his plans for the next million. Mark will show you the exact content atomization techniques used by LearnToProgram that have resulted in steady growth and profitability for the company over its three year life span. You'll learn how to make the most of your marketing content and the content/product you are selling. Living in a world where content is consumed by thousands of diverse mobile devices, a content atomization strategy is now more important than ever.</p><p>This session isn't just designed to hear the story from one successful entrepreneur, but to provide you with techniques and tips for a realistic user acquisition and growth strategy that can be applied to just about any startup.</p><p>Startup | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Mark+Lassoff">Mark Lassoff</a><br />Founder &amp; President, LearnToProgram Media</p><p>Mark Lassoff's parents frequently claim that Mark was born to be a programmer. Starting, in the mid-eighties at age 11, Mark was hard at work on his Commodore 64 writing games in the BASIC language. After completing a computer science degree, Mark developed software for several well-known internet startups during the initial internet boom of the mid 1990’s. Three years ago Mark parlayed a two decades of software development experience in to his latest entrepreneurial venture, LearnToProgram Media.</p><p>LearnToProgram Media publishes online courses that teach mobile, web, and game development. Over 250,000 people have learned programming from Mark through online classes he has either authored or published. In addition to publishing popular courses and books LearnToProgram Media operates an internet video network which produces several programs on software development.</p><p>Previously Mark founded PowerPlant Marketing, which created marketing automation software for REALTORS™. After the sale of PowerPlant, Mark went on to found Internet Broadcasting Group which counted among it’s launch clients Nike, Blue Moon Brewing Company and Opubco.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark lives in Connecticut and speaks worldwide on software development, entrepreneurship and online learning. He has spoken at TechWeek NY, TechWeek LA, and SXSW, among other large conferences. In his spare time he he enjoys aviation, mentoring new business owners and spending time with life-long friends and family.</p><p>B: <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.learntoprogram.tv">blog.learntoprogram.tv</a><br />F: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/LearnToProgramMedia">www.facebook.com/LearnToProgramMedia</a><br />L: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/marklassoff">www.linkedin.com/in/marklassoff</a><br />T: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/mlassoff">www.twitter.com/mlassoff</a><br />W: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.learntoprogram.tv">www.learntoprogram.tv</a><br />G: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/mlassoff">www.github.com/mlassoff</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Synergy of IoT and Big Data</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/synergy-of-iot-and-big-data</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This presentation explores the synergy of IoT and Big Data. We first take a closer look at the Internet of Things and Big Data individually, in terms of what, which, why, where, when, who, how and how much. Then we investigate the relationship between IoT and Big Data. Specifically, we look into how the 4Vs aspects intersect with IoT: Volume, Variety, Velocity and Value. In turn, we analyze how the components of IoT influence Big Data: Device, Connectivity, Context, and Intelligence. We dive deep to the matrix chart of the 1-to-1 mapping separately. Subsequently, we dive deep to the interlock of IoT and Big Data in the business scenarios, in the role of foundational enabler, building block, data source, event channel, signal trigger, collaboration, and synthesization. Case studies will be discussed to further dissect the interplay in real-world business solutions.</p><p>Internet of Things | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Tony+Shan">Tony Shan</a><br />Chief Pragmatist, CTS</p><p>Tony Shan is a renowned thought leader and technology visionary with decades of experience and guru-level knowledge on emerging technologies for pragmatic enterprise computing.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning, we had static websites. Then we invented AJAX, and our websites became alive with dynamic content. Now we're getting to a point where we'd like to have our web applications work in cool asynchronous ways across all of it's connected users. The typically example would be a chat room. You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room. In the past, in order to build a system like that took a lot of time and a heaping amount of code. SignalR is a library that assists you in building real-time, multi-user interactive web applications. In this talk, we'll discuss the current state of the real time web, and then WOW you with quick, easy, and code-filled demos showing off the power of SignalR.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Kevin+Griffin">Kevin Griffin</a><br />Consultant, Griffin Consulting, Inc.</p><p>Kevin Griffin has been working as a professional developer since 2006, where his first job was working on components for the Symantec security suites.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AngularJS, it’s all the rage these days and it's the biggest thing in the JavaScript world since JQuery. Have you heard of it? I’m betting you have if you're a web developer. If you haven’t heard of it, you will the next time you go looking for a job. Perhaps you're a CTO or software development manager and you're wondering if your team should be using AngularJS. In either case, developer or manager, maybe your knowledge is limited to knowing it’s a single-page application framework from Google. Don’t know much else about it? Not to worry. Attend this session and you will learn about the wonderfulness that is AngularJS and there is plenty to learn. You will walk away from this session having learned about directives, views, models, controllers, two-way data binding, expressions, filters, data validation, routing and modules from plenty of code-centric demos. You will also learn where to find more information and additional guidance on taking your next steps on the road to building your first AngularJS application. Web developers with a solid foundation in HTML &amp; JavaScript will benefit most from this session but even newbie web developers will benefit from this introduction to AngularJS.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Jim+Duffy">Jim Duffy</a><br />CEO / Founder, TakeNote Technologies</p><p>Jim Duffy is CEO &amp; founder of TakeNote Technologies, an award-winning training, consulting, and software development company specializing in web developer training and helping clients create business solutions with Microsoft enterprise technologies.

      <title>A Beginners Guide to AngularJS 2.0</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/23/a-beginners-guide-to-angularjs-20</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you miss the stampede to AngularJS? Do you feel that you are too far back to catch up and that the learning curve is too steep to master this technology? Have no fear Angular 2.0 is on the way. Angular 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Angular with an emphasis on simplicity, speed (think mobile), and ease of learning. So if you missed Angular the first time, you can grab this opportunity to learn Angular 2.0 and put yourself ahead of the curve. This session is for beginners and no previous experience with Angular is required (in fact, we will not be spending any time on Angular 1.xx). In this session, you’ll learn the basics of Angular 2.0 and how it uses new and emerging technologies, such as web components, ECMA 6 (the new version of JavaScript) and Typescript (yes! Google is adopting a Microsoft technology) to support modern forward looking web and mobile applications. Coming out of this session, you’ll have a firm grasp on what is behind Angular 2.0 and where the future of the web and mobile development is going. Disclaimer: Angular 2.0 is only in alpha release and not production ready with an anticipated release date of late 2015. At this point it is not backward compatible with Angular 1.xx and will not support legacy browsers, such as IE 9.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Kevin+Hennessy">Kevin Hennessy</a><br />Senior Software Engineer, Applied Information Sciences, Inc.</p><p>Kevin Hennessy is a Senior Software Engineer with AIS in Raleigh, North Carolina.

      <title>Why A Ten-Billion-Dollar SnapChat Is Good News For You: Knowing and Getting Your Market Value</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don't we love to talk about the latest twenty-something overnight Internet billionaires, and their apps worth so much on paper, in stock, for cash, or even in trade for countless strands of bright, shiny beads? But what about the smaller, important successes that happen all around us, all the time? Not so much. We back away from talk of salary and rates. We consider them secondary to the important work of building software. But every day, developers find a way to do the work they love and be paid fairly at the same time, a circumstance that promotes healthy focus on what matters day to day. In this session, you'll learn from the compensation negotiation successes -- and mistakes -- of a nearly twenty-year career as a software developer, in the roles of full-time employee, contractor, unemployed freelancer, and long-term consultant. Discover strategies that will help you recognize and attain your elusive, yet concrete, personal value in the marketplace today.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Jeff+McKenzie">Jeff McKenzie</a><br />Managing Architect, Information Control Company (ICC)</p><p>Jeff McKenzie has worked in software development for nearly twenty years, in both freelance and full-time capacities, as a developer and team leader.

Although he started his career using BASIC on an Atari 800, he took a big detour, getting Biology and English degrees before rediscovering programming, with a new thing called the World Wide Web.

      <title>Best Practices in Big Data Solutions</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/22/best-practices-in-big-data-solutions</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than half of Big Data projects failed to complete. For those completed, most of them fall short of their objectives. There are various reasons that are attributed to this chaos. This talk presents the best practices for Big Data initiatives. To tackle various challenges systematically, we introduce a holistic Big Data operating model in the dimensions of People, Process, and Technology. Then we drill down to the incremental solution process: Discover, Define, Design, Develop, Deploy, and Deliver (6D). We further look into the best practices in each of these stages, such as deliberate planning, roadmap, user perspective, solutioning routine, work breakdown, review, and prototyping, to just name a few. We will also discuss some useful tips as well as antipatterns to help practitioners avoid being lost in pitfalls and traps.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Tony+Shan">Tony Shan</a><br />Chief Pragmatist, CTS</p><p>Tony Shan is a renowned thought leader and technology visionary with decades of field experience and guru-level knowledge on emerging technologies for pragmatic enterprise computing.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All great SignalR demos and presentations show you how easy it is to build an application where server and client communication can happen in real-time. What they never show you is how to handle cases where your SignalR application is running across multiple servers. In the cloud connected world, our servers can span across one or one million servers. Out of box, SignalR is not configured to handle this scenario. Scaling an out of the box SignalR application will result in lost messages and confused users.</p><p>In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will show you the issues with running SignalR in the cloud and how to design an infrastrure that will support multiple SignalR instances.

      <title>TDD For Your Soul: Virtue and Software Engineering</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/23/tdd-for-your-soul-virtue-and-software-engineering</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software engineering pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but, perhaps surprisingly, of character. Using the cardinal virtues as a framework, we can see that developers need courage to continue learning, temperance to prioritize goals, a sense of justice by which to discern obligations, and wisdom to optimize our path. By being honest about where we lack virtue, and implementing steps to develop character, we can perform test-driven development, or TDD, on ourselves. This process can help us grow not only as engineers, but as human beings.</p><p>Soft Skills | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Abraham+Sangha">Abraham Sangha</a><br />Software Engineer, Centro</p><p>Abraham’s first taste of programming was writing violent choose-your-own-adventure games in TI-BASIC on his graphing calculator instead of paying attention during algebra class.

      <title>Maintainable Style Guides</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A style guide is a great collaboration tool to bridge communication gaps between business stakeholders, designers, and developers. Static or living style guides are a great place to start but become increasingly difficult to maintain because style guide generators are dependent on parsing comments in CSS in order to generate HTML patterns and documentation. In short, there is no single source of truth for the HTML leading to maintainability problems. In this session we will discover creating a truly reusable module by creating a pattern API.</p><p>Five things audience members will learn:</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>modular template patterns</li><li>dependency management and versioning per module</li><li>turning modules into the “single source of truth” through a module API</li><li>how to call the API to create a style guide</li><li>how to call the API to create templates and pages within an application</li></ul><p>Technologies used:<br />Node, Angular, React, Component, Sass (Libsass)</p><p>Developer | Level 300 (Advanced)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Bermon+Painter">Bermon Painter</a><br />Practice Manager, User Experience, Cardinal Solutions</p><p>A rootbeer drinking, cupcake eating, Spanish speaking, piano playing, handlebar mustache wearing designer/developer hybrid living in the glorious city of Charlotte, NC&nbsp;</p><p>Bermon is the organizer of various community groups for user experience designers and front-end developers, and the organizer of Blend Conference, a 3-day multi-track event for user experience strategists, designers and developers.

      <title>An Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/23/an-introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Test Driven Development is a technique that requires Unit Tests for code to be written before the code itself. By placing the emphasis on testing, developers can define success before code is written. This helps us answer that elusive question of "when is code done?" TDD offers additional benefits such as only writing code you need to satisfy your requirements, enhanced maintainability, and better modularity. In this presentation we will take a hands on look at TDD by walking through Roy Osherove's "TDD Kata", a daily exercise in Test Driven Development.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Joel+Cochran">Joel Cochran</a><br />Lead Developer, Wintellect</p><p>Joel Cochran is a user experience engineer, web developer, and Lead Developer for WintellectNOW, an on-demand video training service.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing safe concurrent programs has become a principle concern in recent years, as multicore CPUs have become more widespread. Functional languages help developers support concurrency by encouraging immutable data structures that can be passed between threads without having to worry about a shared state.</p><p>This session will cover the actor based concurrency model as base tool to write correct concurrent, reactive, fault-tolerant, scalable applications leveraging the core characteristics of immutability, isolation and asynchronous processing. Actor programming is one of the most widely applicable programming models, which provides support for concurrency, by improving distribution, error detection, and fault tolerance.</p><p>The goal is to provide solid knowledge of and foundation for the Actor model. Following the presentation, attendees will take with them enough material to start to use and leverage the Actor model to write successful concurrent applications.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Riccardo+Terrell">Riccardo Terrell</a><br />Software Architect, Microsoft</p><p>Riccardo Terrell, is a Software Architect at Microsoft who is passionate about functional programming.

      <title>The students who hacked STEM education</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/25/the-students-who-hacked-stem-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 10, 2015 I delivered a 10 minute talk on this same subject at TEDx Greenville.&nbsp;</p><p>My Idea Worth Spreading:</p><p>Challenge # 1: Thousands of students living in every school district across the US live with severe and profound physical and cognitive disabilities. These students typically need expensive “assistive technology” devices to interact with computers. When the devices break, many schools can’t afford to replace them.</p><p>Challenge # 2: Schools across the US are trying to find meaningful and effective ways to teach engineering and design skills to students. These are skills many educational leaders say are critically important for all students to learn if they are to be successful in our new global economy.</p><p>Solution: With the help of a $50 mini “invention kit” developed by MIT grad students, almost any K-12 student can now design, build, and deliver inexpensive assistive technology solutions for students in their own community who live with physical and cognitive disabilities.</p><p>Background:</p><p>This talk is based on a volunteer project I led at a high school in Asheville, NC during the spring of 2014. High school students designed, built, and delivered Assistive Technology solutions for elementary students living with profound physical and cognitive disabilities.</p><p>Internet of Things | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Tom+Heck">Tom Heck</a><br />Integrative STEM Education Evangalist, LEADk12.com</p><p>Tom Heck has worked in education and community development for over 25 years.

      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/de-mystifying-sql-server-performance</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As application and/or SQL developers, you may find yourself writing, or worse, tuning someone else's queries. Sometimes the query will look incredibly complex. Sometimes the query will look simple. In either case, the query may just not be cooperating and takes forever to complete, if it completes at all.</p><p>The challenge for you is to make that query run fast.</p><p>This session will blow the lid off of many of the most common "not-so-best" practices than can lead to poor database performance. In most cases where a query is preforming poorly you don't need to know anything about the underlying data. Instead, finding the root cause of a poorly performing query is often just a matter of going down a mental (or written) checklist of patterns to look for in the query. Recognizing those patterns can either be learned the hard way, or in this session.</p><p>IT Professional | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Dave+Turpin">Dave Turpin</a><br />DBA, Quaero</p><p>Dave has been working with SQL Server since 1996 as a developer, IT manager, and most recently DBA.

He also manages two Netezza massive parallel data warehouse appliances.</p><p>His interests include the SQL Optimizer, query engine, performance tuning and event alerting. Although he has BS and MS degrees in computer science, most of what he knows that is worth sharing has been learned at the School of Hard Knocks. He is easily excited when he learns something new about SQL Server. He has presented some of those topics at several SQL Server focused training events.</p><p>Outside of the database space Dave is a mentor with the Big Brothers, Big Sisters organization (3 years); he is an annual fund raiser for cancer patients; and rides a unicycle for fun and fitness.</p><p>B: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daveturpin.com">www.daveturpin.com</a><br />T: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/sobrietytesting">www.twitter.com/sobrietytesting</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Software Craftsmanship and Agile Code Games</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/18/software-craftsmanship-and-agile-code-games</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join us to talk about what it means to be a software craftsman, how the <a target="_blank" href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a>&nbsp;provides a framework for us to improve.&nbsp;</p><p>A large part of being a software craftsman is practice. Using different "code games" we can have a full toolbelt of activities that will help us (and those around us) become better at our craft.</p><p>Agile software development promises the ability to deliver value quickly. But this isn’t just a matter of process. Uncle Bob says "the only way to go fast is to go well."&nbsp;But how do we go well? As software developers, we can only deliver features as fast as the code base and our skills allow us.

With new server frameworks coming out every couple of years, and client libraries springing up like mushrooms after the rain, the task of choosing how to implement your web application is becoming harder than ever. Will you go for Single Page Application (SPA) development, based on libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, Knockout, etc., or will you "play it safe" with server-side frameworks such as ASP.NET MVC? In this 2-hour session, we will explore both those options and show you the pros and cons of each platform and technology. Using several common scenarios of web development, we will give you the tools to decide which is best for your scenario.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Michael+Haberman">Michael Haberman</a><br />Consultant &amp; Lecturer, SELA Group</p><p>Michael Haberman MCT, MCPD is a senior consultant and lecturer.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So all the hip cats are preaching the Git Gospel, pushing everything to the GitHub promised land. But what is Git anyway? Should you use it? How is it different from other Version Control systems? What is Version Control anyway, and why do I need it? Turns out all of these questions can be answered by a quick trip through history. Newly discovered ancient writings reveal the sprawling province of Gitlandia, an early distributed civilization that bears an eerie resemblance to Git. Exploration of Gitlandia will be followed by a close look at Git itself, how to use it, and how it works with remote systems such as Visual Studio Online, and yes, even GitHub.</p><p>Developer | Level 100 (Beginner)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=Jeff+McKenzie">Jeff McKenzie</a><br />Managing Architect, Information Control Company (ICC)</p><p>Jeff McKenzie has worked in software development for nearly twenty years, in both freelance and full-time capacities, as a developer and team leader.

      <title>Optimize Yourself! Developer Analytics for Visual Studio Users</title>
      <link>/sessions/2015/4/25/optimize-yourself-developer-analytics-for-visual-studio-users</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developers love data. We track our website hits, we track download numbers, and recently, with the advent of FitBit, many of us even track our physical activity. Thus, it was only a matter of time until we began tracking our own software development behavior. With the introduction of tools like <a target="_blank" href="https://wakatime.com/">Waka Time</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="https://codealike.com/">Codealike</a>&nbsp;developers can now *automatically* track their daily activity inside of Visual Studio. Using this data developers can self optimize; they can gain visibility into their own strengths and weaknesses, identify problematic classes or files, and even have friendly competitions with teammates. In this talk I'll draw from my knowledge of these products, my experience running a two-year ABB-internal <a target="_blank" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2591171">developer analytics research project</a>, and my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tasktop.com/about/press/eclipse-mylyn-3.1-time-tracking.php">previous work</a>&nbsp;on <a target="_blank" href="http://tasktop.com/time-tracking">primitive developer analytics</a>&nbsp;as employee #9 at a startup.&nbsp;</p><p>After this talk developers can expect to understand the current developer analytics landscape, be able to choose which solution is right for their team, and understand the difference between meaningful analytics and analytics that are just for fun.</p><p>Developer | Level 200 (Intermediate)</p><p><a href="/sessions/?tag=David+Shepherd">David C. Shepherd</a><br />Senior Principal Scientist, ABB Inc.</p><p>David C. Shepherd is lead software engineering researcher for ABB, Inc. and is based in Raleigh, N.C. &nbsp;As a member of ABB's Software Engineering Research Group he focuses on improving developer productivity and increasing software quality. &nbsp;While he is a researcher, and thus often found writing papers and attending research conferences, his industrial background compels him to also implement his ideas as industrial tools and evangelize them at developer conferences.</p><p>B: <a target="_blank" href="http://davidshepherd.weebly.com">davidshepherd.weebly.com</a><br />T: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/davidcshepherd">www.twitter.com/davidcshepherd</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
